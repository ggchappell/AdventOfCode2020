Notes on Day 9
==============

Programs `solve-09*.py` have an optional command-line argument
indicating how many previous numbers to consider. This defaults to 25,
so the regular input needs no special treatment.

    > solve-09a.py < input.txt

However, the test input needs an argument of 5.

    > solve-09a.py 5 < test1.txt
